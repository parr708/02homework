    <p class="about">I am originally from Nebraska. We Nebraskan's are die hard Husker fans.  I am proud to share my grandfather was the youngest player to play for 
      Nebraska at 16 years old!  When my grandfather passed away my grandmother went back to school at University of Nebraska and I am proud to say is 
      the oldest Husker to graduate at 83!

  <p class="about">I am a very physically active person.  I like to walk, run, and be physically active.  One of my favorite activities is disc golf.  Not everyone knows
    what disc golf is.  It's like golf with frisbees.  You have 18 holes and fly a frisbee into the basket.  You try to get it in the fewest shots possible.
    I like it so much I bought my own basket and have it in my front lawn to play H-O-R-S-E with friends and family.

  <p class="about">I am an avid reader and love great fiction as well as self development.  I choose three authors here that I really enjoy that each bring me great enjoyment.  Napolean Hill
    wrote one of the greatest selling books of all time with 'Think and Grow Rich'.  Stephen King is in my opinion is brilliant and can write such a range of books from 'Firestarter' to 'Shawshank Redemption'.
    Steven Pressfield was a former marine that is amazing in his own right, writing self help, fiction, and historical fiction.
